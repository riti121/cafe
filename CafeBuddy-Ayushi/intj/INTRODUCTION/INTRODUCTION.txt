“Thought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.”
. Architects make up just two percent of the population, and women with this personality type are especially rare, forming only 0.8%. It can be difficult for Architects to find people who can keep up with their non-stop analysis of things. People with this personality type are imaginative yet decisive... ambitious yet like their privacy... curious about everything but remain focused.

“You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.”
Architects are self-confident in the skills and ideas they focus on. Using their insights and logic, they push innovation through by sheer willpower.They typically apply a sense of perfectionism and even morality to all their work. Anyone who can’t keep up with Architects’ processes or doesn’t see the point of them is likely to lose their respect.
Architect personality types dislike rules, restrictions, and traditions. For them, everything should be subject to questions and reviews. When they can, Architects often act alone, and their approaches are usually innovative and unique. This personality type always looks for new tactics, strategies, and contingency plans. They constantly outsmart their peers as they maintain control, all the while making the most of their independent style of thinking.
Architects, ever independent, remain free from the expectations of others. This allows them to pursue their own interesting and fresh ideas.
